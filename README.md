# Diffie Hellman-Java

README

This program is used to emulate how the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used. It calculates the shared secret key between two clients as within real life settings. This specific implementation lets the user select the base and modulus values, as well as letting them select the private keys for both clients. It then calculates and outputs all keys involved in a table format within the console.

How to run:

Run Diffie_Hellman.java in chosen Java environment. 
User will be prompted to enter Modulus & Base values in console, these must be prime integers. 
User will then be prompted to enter the private keys for Alice and Bob, these must be a valid integers. 
The program will then print out the base and modulus values. 
Finally the program will print out a table showcasing the chosen private keys, the newly created public keys and the shared secret key for Alice & Bob. 

CONSTRAINTS

jUnit and Jupiter modules may have to be imported in order to run the testing modules

IDE
